2008-01-18  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (EXTRAS): Include erc-list-old.el.

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-dcc-verbose): Rename from erc-verbose-dcc.
	(erc-pack-int): Rewrite to not depend on a count argument.
	(erc-unpack-int): Rewrite to remove 4-character limitation.
	(erc-dcc-server): Call set-process-coding-system and
	set-process-filter-multibyte so that the contents get sent out
	without modification.
	(erc-dcc-send-filter): Don't take a substring -- just pass the
	whole string to erc-unpack-int.
	(erc-dcc-receive-cache): New option that indicates the number of
	bytes to let the receive buffer grow before flushing it.
	(erc-dcc-file-name): New buffer-local variable to keep track of
	the filename of the currently-received file.
	(erc-dcc-get-file): Disable undo for a speed increase.  Set
	erc-dcc-file-name.  Truncate the file before writing to it.
	(erc-dcc-append-contents): New function to append the contents of
	a buffer to a file and then erase the contents of the buffer.
	(erc-dcc-get-filter): Flush buffer contents after exceeding
	erc-dcc-receive-cache.  This allows large files to be downloaded
	without storing the whole thing in memory.
	(erc-dcc-get-sentinel): Flush any remaining contents before
	closing.  No need to save buffer.
	(erc-dcc-listen-host): New option that determines which IP address
	to listen on.
	(erc-dcc-public-host): New option that determines which IP address
	to advertise when sending a file.  This is useful for people who
	are on a local subnet.  Together, these two options replace
	erc-dcc-host.

	* erc.el (erc-mode-line-format): Add %N and %S.  %N is the name of
	the network, and %S is much like %s but with the network name
	trumping the server name.  Default to "%S %a".  Thanks to e1f for
	the suggestion.
	(erc-format-network): New function that formats the network name.
	(erc-format-target-and/or-network): New function that formats both
	the network name and target, falling back on the server name if
	the network name is not available.
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Add the new format spec items.

2008-01-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-join-buffer): Improve documentation.
	(erc-query-display): New option indicating how to display a query
	buffer that is made by using the /QUERY command.  The default is
	to display the query in a new window.
	(erc-cmd-QUERY): Use it.  Improve docstring.
	(erc-auto-query): Default this to 'window-noselect instead,
	because I've already seen bug reports about new users thinking
	that ERC didn't display their test messages.  Improve
	customization type.
	(erc-notice-face): Make this work with XEmacs.
	(erc-join-buffer): Mention 'buffer in docstring.  Improve
	customization type.

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-dcc-send-sentinel): Better handle case where elt
	is nil, in order to avoid an error.  Thanks to Brent Goodrick for
	the initial patch.
	(erc-dcc-display-send): New function split from erc-dcc-send-hook.
	(erc-dcc-send-connect-hook): Use it -- we don't like lambda forms
	in hooks.
	(erc-dcc-send-filter): Display byte count if the client confirmed
	too much, and kill the buffer.  Otherwise a DoS might be possible
	by making Emacs run out of RAM.

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-connect): Detect early on whether the
	connection attempt has failed in order to avoid confusing error
	messages.

	* erc-networks.el (erc-server-alist): Add Rizon network.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-passwords): Add Rizon to options.
	(erc-nickserv-alist): Add support for Rizon.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-find-face): Don't let buttons in notices
	trump default text.  Use catch/throw.  Default to first element of
	FACES is nothing is found.

	* erc-xdcc.el: Add local variables for proper indentation setup.

2008-01-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-coding-system): Docfix.
	(erc-coding-system-for-target): Pass the `target' argument along
	as the first and only argument.  It's not good to just depend on a
	dynamic binding.

2008-01-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (321, 322): Split message-displaying parts into
	new functions, which are added to each response's respective
	hook.  This makes them easier to disable.

	* erc-list.el: New file from Tom Tromey.  Use erc-propertize
	instead of propertize.  Require 'erc.
	(list): New module definition.  Remove message-displaying
	functions for 321 and 322 response handlers when enabling the
	module, and restore them when disabling.  As a sanity check,
	remove the erc-list-handle-322 function when disabling the module.
	(erc-list-handle-322): Handle the case where we run the LIST
	command, but do not go through the normal steps.
	(erc-cmd-LIST): Add docstring.  Strip initial space from line if
	it is non-nil.  Use make-local-variable to silence compiler
	warning.  Capture current buffer and pass it to
	erc-list-install-322-handler.
	(erc-list-install-322-handler): Take server-buffer argument, so
	that we are certain of being in the right buffer.  Use 4th
	argument to add-hook, so that erc-server-322-functions is only
	modified in one buffer.

	* erc-list-old.el: Renamed from old erc-list.el.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Add list-old.
	(erc-set-topic): Handle case where there are no newlines in the
	existing topic, which happens when /LIST is run.
	(erc-notice-face): If we have less than 88 colors, make this
	blue.  Otherwise the text will be pink in a tty, which looks
	dreadful.  Thanks to e1f for the report.
	(erc-remove-parsed-property): New option that determines whether
	to remove the erc-parsed property after displaying a message.
	This should have the effect of making ERC take up less memory.
	(erc-display-line-1): Use it.

2008-01-04  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* erc-ibuffer.el (erc-channel-modes):
	Pass mode-name through format-mode-line
