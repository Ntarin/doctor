	* erc-backend.el (erc-process-sentinel-1): Don't try to re-open a
	process if a SIGPIPE occurs.  This happens when a new message
	comes in at the same time a /quit is requested.
	(erc-process-sentinel): Use string-match rather than string= to do
	these comparisons.  Matching literal newlines makes me nervous.
